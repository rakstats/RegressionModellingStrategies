# RegressionModellingStrategies
Tutorial for using rms and Hmisc packages, inspired by the Regression Modelling Strategies book by Prof Frank Harrell.

The original article that I have used to produce some of the Rcodes can be found at [written by Nicholas Ollberding](/https://www.nicholas-ollberding.com/post/an-introduction-to-the-harrell-verse-predictive-modeling-using-the-hmisc-and-rms-packages).
